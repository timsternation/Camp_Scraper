# Camp_Scraper

This is a little script I put together to track down email addresses and contact names for the following site: http://find.acacamps.org/

The script also finds out the state in which a camp is located and whether or not it has ACA accredidation. All of the text is located in one field, so it was difficult to pull out names and there are a few erroneous entries. Any suggestions for improvement are welcome!
